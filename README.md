# Anima

This project is an application of the concepts and code presented in Gabor Szauer's [Hands-On C++ Game Animation Programming](https://animationprogramming.com).
It supports **loading a [glTF](https://www.khronos.org/Gltf) model and rendering blended skinned animations**, with the skinning logic being run on the GPU or on the CPU depending
on the configuration. It is written in C++, with OpenGL being used for rendering and [glfw](https://www.glfw.org/) for the window context.
